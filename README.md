# INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
(Mini Project using Core Python)

---

# INTRODUCTION

Inventory Management System is a simple console-based application developed using Core Python.
The system helps to manage product details such as product ID, product name, quantity, and price.

This project is developed as  mini project to understand basic Python programming concepts and to implement real-world applications using simple logic.

---

# OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT

- To learn and implement Python programming basics
- To understand the use of dictionaries for data storage
- To perform add, view, Update and Delete
- To improve logical thinking using conditions and loops
- To develop a menu-driven program

---

# SCOPE OF THE PROJECT

This project is suitable for:

- Beginners in Python
- Practice of core programming concepts

---

# Concepts Used:
   - Dictionary
   - If-Else Conditions
   - While Loop
   - Input / Output

---

# SYSTEM FEATURES

- Add new product details
- View all available products
- Update product quantity and price
- Delete product details
- Simple and user-friendly menu

---
# 
DATA STRUCTURE USED

The project uses a dictionary to store inventory data.
Format:

inventory = {
    product_id: [product_name, quantity, price]
}

---

# WORKING OF THE SYSTEM

1. The program displays a menu to the user
2. The user selects an operation
3. Based on the choice, the program performs:
   - Add
   - View
   - Update
   - Delete
4. The loop continues until the user selects Exit

---
# SAMPLE MENU
1. Add Product
2. View Products
3. Update Product
4. Delete Product
5. Exit

---

# LIMITATIONS

- Data is not stored permanently
- No database connection
- Single user system

---
# CONCLUSION

This Inventory Management System successfully demonstrates how basic Python concepts can be used to build a real-world application.
The project helped in understanding programming logic, data handling, and problem-solving skills.
